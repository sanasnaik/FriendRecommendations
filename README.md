# FriendRecommendations
Project that uses Apache Hadoop's MapReduce algorithm to recommend friends to different users on a social media platform.
On a high level, it goes through the input data, formatted <USER><TAB><FRIENDSLIST>, and gives the top 10 friend recommendations to people who are not already direct friends, but share a lot of mutual friends.
